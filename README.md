# cryptographyframework
Creating a Framework for deciphering ciphers from the Caesar cipher to modern ciphers employing both bruteforcing methods and mathmatics (such as frequency analysis for monoalphabaic ciphers)

This is a toolset for myself to learn more about cryptology I'm creating individual scripts that eventually I will make into classes that can be referenced by a main application for analyzing many different forms of encyrption (eventually) for now they are individual scripts because I want them ready for an upcoming security conference I am going to. This is mostly for my own learning however if you want to clone or fork I can't stop you :). Also I recognize there are things that I could do better and more effeciently but I'm in the process of learning these things and will work on these issues as I find them and as I have time.
